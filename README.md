Hi, I'm Karan, aka DatIndiKid.

You can find projects related to the following here --

-> Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence
-> Win32 SDK
-> Programming practice problems from various books (Will update the list here, once it has been uploaded)
-> Programming practice problems from various online sources (Will update the list here, with links and all)
-> Any other programming projects I take up any time.

I'm currently learning Operating Systems, Software Development using Win32 SDK and COM, and Machine Learning/AI.

I'd love to collaborate on projects involving the same!
